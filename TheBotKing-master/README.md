# TheBotKing
A simple bot I coded using Discord.js, it uses sqlite to store data regarding what game i will mod next so its a good example on how to use sqlite for your discord bot and save data non-runtime

# server.js
The main .js file containing the bot's code

# package.json
The package file containg the dependancies, name and other info about the package

# watch.json
Only required if you are using glitch.me to run your bot like me, this file stops glitch for re-loging in your bot after every code edit made online 

# scores.sqlite
The sqlite file where the data gets saved, its a blank file
