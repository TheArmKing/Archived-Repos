# AutoSmali
A simple script that automatically adds your smali popup code for your APK Mods

# Description
Usage - smali [decompiled folder]

You will then get to choose the code you want to copy, to make a new code paste it in a text file and move to /Users/username/AutoSmali

Some toasts require you to move a folder or image file, you can do that also, look at the SampleFolder in /Users/username/AutoSmali, you must have a config.txt specifying the file/folder name, and the path

If any of your .txt code files or folder files dont appear in the select menu it could be 1 of the following reasons :-

    1. the filename contains spaces
    2. the specified filename ( in the config.txt ) doesnt exist
