4) How to Get the IDs ? 
   ---> You can check the PlayStore Page for the Bundle ID
            >> Example - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miniclip.eightballpool  the id is          
                         com.miniclip.eightballpool
5) You Can only track apps on the PlayStore ( Not gay stuff like Fortnite ). 
6) Some PlayStore games have the current version listed as 'Varies with Device', in that case, the tool scrapes the      
   https://apk4fun.com version of the page. If Your game is listed as 'Varies with Device' and not available on apk4fun, DM me     
   on Discord TheArmKing#6647
