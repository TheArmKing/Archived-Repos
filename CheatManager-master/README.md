4) How to Get the IDs ? 
   ---> You can check http://armconverter.com/igappinfo/ for the Game's Bundle ID
   ---> If you can find the Bundle ID on igappinfo, then use the AppStore Website to get iTunes ID
            >> Example - https://itunes.apple.com/id/app/8-ball-pool/id543186831?mt=8  the id is 543186831
5) The IDs are case sensitive! ( Some devs has same ID for Phone and Mac version )
